##  Even if this file is shared on my public git hub it has not been designed ##
##  for public use. It was not created with the idea that someone else would  ##
##  be using it. The files in this repository have been created for my usage  ##
##  only. They are available so you can see how I have customized my system.  ##
##  I decided to put them in the public space so anyone can download them     ##
##  and edit them. I hope this can inspire someone or serve as a reference.   ##
